            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Slice of Life provides professional role models to arm participants with usable
                tools to avoid negative pressures for drug use, teen pregnancy, violence, criminal
                behavior and gang affiliation. We provide activities that are educational, challenging,
                rewarding and fun. We reach out to the youth of our community to share
                information and ideas on how we can all work together for a brighter tomorrow by
                decreasing the number of school drop-outs and increasing the number of
                high-school and college graduates. Over the past 31 years, 70% or more of the
                Slice of Life participants have gone on to post-secondary education as a result of
                having taken advantage of opportunities afforded to them in the program. Slice of
                Life alumni have returned to the program in the area of leadership, tutoring,
                mentoring and fundraising.
